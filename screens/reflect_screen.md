# Reflect Screen ‚Äì VibeWise

## üß≠ Purpose

The Reflect screen allows users to capture emotional experiences by logging a "New Moment." It forms the core of personal insight in VibeWise. Users document their current or past emotional state using an intuitive structure that includes mood, timestamp, tags, and an optional voice log.

## ‚ú® Structure

This screen is broken down into:

* Mood selection (emotion slider)
* Moment description (free text)
* Theme tags
* Timestamp selection (Now or Set Time)
* Optional voice recording (with AI emotion analysis)

## üé® UI Guidelines

* Reflects the app‚Äôs minimalistic, high-design aesthetic
* Emotion slider grouped in three categories:

  * High: Joy, Empowerment, Clarity, Inspiration
  * Neutral: Calm, Acceptance, Curiosity
  * Low: Fear, Frustration, Shame, Overwhelm
* Use grouped button-style selectors or pill components
* Theme/tag selector uses chips (preset or user-defined)
* Input area for free-text
* ‚ÄúAdd Voice Log‚Äù (mic icon) triggers voice recording overlay
* Timestamp defaults to `Now` with option to open time picker
* Final CTA: "Log Reflection"
